# Pattern Library Update Summary

## Task Completed
Successfully parsed and implemented a comprehensive juggling pattern library based on curriculum flowchart patterns, updating the `src/services/patternLibrary.ts` file with a complete collection of juggling patterns.

## What Was Implemented

### Pattern Categories Added:
1. **Solo Patterns (6 patterns)**
   - One Ball Flash
   - Two Ball Columns
   - Two Ball Flash
   - Three Ball Cascade
   - Three Ball Flash
   - Four Ball Fountain

2. **Partner Passing Patterns (3 patterns)**
   - 6 Count (foundation passing)
   - 4 Count (intermediate passing)
   - 2 Count (advanced rapid passing)

3. **Zap Patterns (2 patterns)**
   - Single Zap
   - Double Zap

4. **Feed Patterns (2 patterns)**
   - Two Person Feed (3 jugglers)
   - Three Person Feed (4 jugglers)

5. **Movement Patterns (2 patterns)**
   - Walking Pass
   - Weaving

6. **Ball Passing (2 patterns)**
   - Ball Passing Basics
   - Shower Pass

7. **Technical Patterns (2 patterns)**
   - Slam
   - Flip

8. **Advanced Combinations (1 pattern)**
   - Zap Slam Combo

### Total: 20 Comprehensive Curriculum Patterns

## Key Features Implemented:

### Pattern Structure
Each pattern includes:
- Unique ID with category prefix (solo_, partner_, zap_, etc.)
- Name, difficulty level, and required juggler count
- Props type (balls, clubs, rings)
- Detailed description and relevant tags
- Source information (Curriculum Flowchart)
- Prerequisites chain for learning progression
- Timing type (fully_sync, semi_sync, fully_async)
- Technical details (numberOfProps, period, squeezes)
- Siteswap notation (local and global where applicable)
- Word descriptions for each juggler
- Ground state indicators

### Service Methods Added:
- `getCurriculumPatterns()` - Get all curriculum patterns
- `getPatternsByDifficulty(difficulty)` - Filter by Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced
- `getPatternsByTag(tag)` - Filter by tags (solo, partner, zap, etc.)
- `getPatternsByJugglerCount(count)` - Filter by number of jugglers required
- `getPatternsByProp(prop)` - Filter by prop type (balls, clubs, rings)
- `getBeginnerProgression()` - Get recommended learning progression
- `searchPatterns(query)` - Search by name, description, or tags

### Learning Progression
Patterns are organized with proper prerequisite chains:
- Solo patterns progress from 1 ball → 2 balls → 3 balls → 4 balls
- Partner patterns build from 6 Count → 4 Count → 2 Count
- Advanced patterns require mastery of foundational patterns
- Zap patterns build on basic passing
- Feed patterns require partner passing experience

### Integration
- Updated `src/data/patterns.ts` to use the new curriculum patterns
- All patterns conform to the existing Pattern type interface
- Maintains compatibility with existing pattern search and filtering functions
- Ready for immediate use throughout the application

## Technical Compliance
- All patterns use valid TypeScript types (ExperienceLevel, PropType, TimingType)
- Proper siteswap notation where applicable
- Complete source attribution
- Public visibility for all curriculum patterns
- Consistent ID naming convention
- Proper prerequisite relationships

## Files Modified:
1. `src/services/patternLibrary.ts` - Completely replaced with comprehensive curriculum patterns
2. `src/data/patterns.ts` - Updated to import from the new pattern library
3. `test-pattern-library.js` - Created test script to verify functionality

The pattern library now contains a complete curriculum-based collection suitable for juggling education and practice, with proper progression paths from beginner to advanced levels across solo, partner, and group juggling patterns.
